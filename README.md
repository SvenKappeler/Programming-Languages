# Programming Languages

This repository is a collection of assignments completed for the course CSC 344 - Programming Languages. The assignments cover two main languages: Racket and Prolog. 

## Structure of the Repository

The repository is structured as follows:

- Each assignment has its own separate folder.
- Inside each folder, you will find the following files:
  - A PDF document containing the problem specification for the assignment.
  - A PDF document containing a write-up of the solution. This will include images of the code along with the outputs from the code. They contain the outputs from the IDE to demonstrate the code is functioning

## Languages Used

- **Racket:** A multi-paradigm programming language that is part of the Lisp family. Racket is used for its robust macro system and its ability to easily create domain-specific languages.

- **Prolog:** A logic programming language associated with artificial intelligence and computational linguistics. Prolog's strength in pattern matching and its declarative nature make it well-suited for problems in these domains.

The repository provides a comprehensive look at the different programming paradigms and techniques utilized in both Racket and Prolog, providing valuable insights into the diverse world of programming languages.
